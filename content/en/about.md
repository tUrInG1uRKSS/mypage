Hello! I am **Leandro Llontop Herrera**, a Mechatronics Engineer and Robotics enthusiast driven by the control of complex systems and mechatronic integration.

I am currently pursuing a Master's in **Robotics, Automation & Embedded Systems** at **IMT Atlantique** in Nantes, France. My academic journey spans across Peru, Germany, and France, giving me a unique international perspective and a versatile problem-solving approach.

### What Drives Me?
I seek to contribute to innovative projects that combine control, perception, and will change the world.

### Beyond Engineering
I believe in discipline and teamwork, values I cultivate through sports. I am an active **Football & Futsal player**. I am also passionate about **Formula 1** (for the engineering and strategy!), cinema, and table tennis. 

I am actively looking for an **internship opportunity (4+ months) starting in April 2025**. If you are looking for a rigorous, curious, and adaptable engineer, let's connect!
